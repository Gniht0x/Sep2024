A <font face=Times New Roman size=5><i><b>shepherd</i></b></font> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</p>

<p align=justify>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!"Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn't find any wolf.
</p>

<p align=justify>
The boy laughed and replied,"It was just fun. There is no wolf here". <font size=5><b><i>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</b></i></font>
</p>

<p align=justify>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs.The boy was frightened and cried loudly,"Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf  is carrying a lamb away!"</strike>
</p>

<p align=justify>
<font size=4.5 color=purple>The farmers <font size=3><sup>thought</sup></font> the boy was playing<font size=3> <sub>mischief</sub></font> again. </font>So, no one paid attention to him to him and didn't come to his help.
